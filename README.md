## Personal Insight
> Peaky Finder is the result of an accelerated web development educational program. The front end utilizes modern JavaScript frameworks: React and Redux. The back end relies on the tried-and-true stack: PHP and MySQL.

> Peaky Finder demanded more than just technical skills. The early weeks of developement saw constant Agile standups, with discussions regarding what technologies to use (Pure JavaScript vs React, React vs React/Redux, PHP vs Node.js, MySQL vs NoSQL, etc.). Features were suggested, planned, refined, removed, or set aside during planning.

> The end of weeks of planning, development, and coding resulted in a well polished web application that we are proud to have made.
